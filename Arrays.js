//Arrays are objects in JS, typeof returns "object"
//Syntax:

const cars = ["XUV", "BMW", "Dodge"];
const nums = [1, 22, 78, 90, 10];

//Arrays can also be defined as object by using "new Array" keyword:
const cities = new Array ("BOM", "DEL", "GOA");

//converting an array to string can be done by using toString() function

//Looping array elements can be done by:
//1. using for loop
//2. Using forEach()
//3. using map()
