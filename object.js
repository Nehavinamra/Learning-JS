//Object in Js is Non-primitive datatype
//The object datatype can contain: An array, A date, an object 
//eg:
const person ={
  firstName: "Neha",
  lastName: "Vinamra",
  age: 22
};

//The key values of an object can be altered, deleted, added

//Object can also be declared without any properties as:
const person = new object();
const arr = new Array("hi", "hola");

//or even as an empty object:
const person ={};

//Object property invoked with () returns the property but without returns the function defination
